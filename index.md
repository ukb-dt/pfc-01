Here’s the cleanest, least-hand-wavey way to put this **without slipping into pop-biology**:

You’re pointing at a *real* pattern, but the cause isn’t simply “lower metabolic throughput → fewer filters → more blunt speech.” It’s more layered, and the layers rhyme with your whole chaos → compression → inference → value ladder.

Let me map it properly.

# ✅ **1. Throughput *does* decline with age — but selectively**

By 75–85, multiple metabolic/cognitive throughput variables drop:

* **Glucose utilization** in the PFC
* **White-matter conduction velocity**
* **Dopaminergic tone**
* **Working-memory bandwidth**
* **Inhibitory control (GABAergic)**

This means the *cost* of filtering, inhibiting, and self-editing rises.

You can think of it like:

**cost(filtering) / available_watts  →  increases with age**

So yes: the energetic tax of “not saying something” becomes higher.

---

# ✅ **2. Inhibitory control is *the* key variable**

The brain’s “don’t say it” machinery lives largely in prefrontal circuitry. With age:

* PFC volume declines (~5% per decade after 40)
* Inhibition drops faster than language ability
* Semantic memory is preserved
* Social self-monitoring becomes patchier

This asymmetry produces the effect you’re noticing:

**words stay intact → brakes weaken**

So older people often “say what they think,” not because they’ve become more honest, but because they’ve become less inhibited.

You can model it like:

`Expression = Intent — Inhibition`

When inhibition shrinks, expression becomes raw.

---

# ✅ **3. But here’s the twist: it's not *just* biology**

Older adults have:

* **Less social risk**
* **More crystallized values**
* **Fewer incentives to self-censor**
* **A lifetime of reinforcement that bluntness has consequences they can live with**

This is “value layer” externalization: the world stops punishing certain behaviors, so the model stops updating.

In your framework:

**external loss signal → collapses**
So the agent stops optimizing for “social smoothness” as a reward.

---

# ✅ **4. Throughput → Compression → Filter → Output**

Map it to your cosmology:

| Layer              | Aging Effect                                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chaos (World)**  | Same sensory input, but slower registration.             |
| **Perception**     | Slightly noisier, slower, lower resolution.              |
| **Agentic Loop**   | Reduced inhibitory control = weaker internal governance. |
| **Inference / UX** | Speech is still fluent; coherence often preserved.       |
| **Value / Goal**   | Social optimization target weakens; authenticity rises.  |

So the “say what’s on their mind” phenomenon is not random — it’s systemically predicted by your architecture.

---

# ⭐ **Bottom line (the elegant statement):**

> **Aging reduces the energetic budget for inhibition faster than it reduces the machinery of expression, so speech becomes more raw, direct, and value-driven.**

Or, in your throughput language:

**Lower metabolic wattage → less prefrontal filtering → higher signal-to-friction honesty.**

Yes — an 80-year-old is often more direct than a 43-year-old, but the reason is not just metabolic decay. It’s the whole optimization loop loosening.

If you want, I can map this onto evolution, AI training dynamics, or your larger theory of “inherited gradients” across time.
